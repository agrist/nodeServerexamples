<h1>Llumi, the Huntress</h1>

<p>Llumi is our sweet, but <em>ferocious</em> hunter-kitty. Maybe it's because she was born out in the wild (OK, the parking lot of the <a href="http://www.elizabethcastro.com/html4_4e/examples/styles_layout/commonwealth.htm">place my brother-in-law works</a>) or maybe because she was an orphan (he found her when she and her six brothers and sisters were just two days old.) Then again, maybe it's because we brought her home to a rather hostile environment: a fiercely territorial <a href="http://www.elizabethcastro.com/html4_4e/examples/styles_layout/cookie.html">Catalan cat</a> who had just had a baby of her own, who didn't see any reason why she should share her bed (that is, <em>our</em> bed), with this outsider, an American, no less.
</p><h1>Xixona, the Hungry </h1>
<p>Xixona, we call her Xixo (pronounced Shi-shoe) for short, looks like a carbon-copy of her mother, <a href="http://www.elizabethcastro.com/html4_4e/examples/styles_layout/cookie.html">Cookie</a>, if a bit darker. It's very easy to tell them apart, though, all you have to do is start feeding her. Xixo is instantly transformed from a sweet, quiet, affectionate cat to a demanding cry-baby. "Now," she says. "It's about time you finally got around to giving me something to eat. I haven't eaten all day and I'm hungry. I've been telling you for the last two hours that it was time, you know. Because sometimes you forget and I couldn't bear it if you fed me three minutes later than you did yesterday, and what is your problem? How is it that you go so interminably slow? It can't be that hard to work that can opener. If you'd just let me have at it, I'd be eating already. But no, you've got to take your time..." and she goes on and on, during the approximately 30 seconds it takes me to open a can of food and spoon some out into her dish, oh yes, and place it on the floor in front of her. Very, very impatient, she is.
