//example how to divide into modules the Sass code - use imports
@import 'partial3';
//the actual files have to be named as "_name.scss" and have to be in the same folder
@import 'dynamic';
//imports don't have separate "namespaces" so they can use the same variables
// watch out for that! or use to your advantage by creating oneimport with all variable definitions
//to get the final code - compile this file



//generate some extra sass conditions before compiling
//also try to put in some code inbetween the imports to see how the generated css handles it
//
